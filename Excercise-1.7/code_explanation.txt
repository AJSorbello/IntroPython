 Explanation of the Code
Base Class: The Base variable is used to define the declarative base class, which allows us to define models in a more Pythonic way.

Table Definition:

__tablename__ = 'final_recipes' specifies the name of the table as final_recipes.
The model contains columns for id, name, ingredients, cooking_time, and difficulty.
id is an integer and the primary key with auto-increment.
name is a string with a 50-character limit.
ingredients is a string with a 255-character limit.
cooking_time is an integer representing the cooking time in minutes.
difficulty is a string with a 20-character limit.
Representation Methods:

__repr__ method gives a quick representation of the Recipe object.
__str__ method provides a formatted string representation of the Recipe.
Helper Methods:

calculate_difficulty: Calculates and assigns the difficulty of a recipe based on the number of ingredients and cooking time.
return_ingredients_as_list: Returns the ingredients as a list.
Creating the Table:

Base.metadata.create_all(engine) ensures that the final_recipes table is created in the database if it doesnâ€™t already exist.
3. Running the Script
When you run this script, it will create the final_recipes table in your MySQL database and be ready for CRUD operations.
