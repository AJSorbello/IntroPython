# Pre-Work: Before You Start the Course

## Reflection Questions (to complete before your first mentor call)

1. What experiences have you had with coding and/or programming so far? What other experiences (programming-related or not) have you had that may help you as you progress through this course?

Answer:  - I haven't had any coding experience prior to CareerFoundry. I have completed Full Stack Immersion, which covers the MEARN and MEAN stack. Check out my portfolio [here](https://ajsorbello.github.io/AJfolio/). My experience in staying focused and completing tasks comes from working at computer/desk jobs for the last 20+ years in sales, customer service, creative arts, using LOS/POS, CRM, DAWs, marketing tools, and many other software creative tools.

2. What do you know about Python already? What do you want to know?

Answer: - I know that Python is a programming language used for various applications like video games, AI, and machine learning. I understand that many jobs require Python experience, and I want to learn more about it.

3. What challenges do you think may come up while you take this course? What will help you face them? Think of specific spaces, people, and times of day or week that might be favorable for facing challenges and growing. Plan for how to solve challenges that arise.

Answer: - Like any new language, there is a learning curve. Staying focused on the course and overcoming challenges is key. When I encounter a problem, I will analyze it and work through various possible solutions until I find the right method.

*Remember, you can always refer to Exercise 1.4 of the Orientation course if you‚Äôre not sure whom to reach out to for help and support.*

## Exercise 1.1: Getting Started with Python

### Learning Goals

- Summarize the uses and benefits of Python for web development
- Prepare your developer environment for programming with Python

### Reflection Questions

1. In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?

Answer:  - Frontend is the part of the website that the user sees and interacts with. Backend is what the user does not see, including the infrastructure and data management that power the frontend. Backend operations handle data storage, retrieval, updates, user authentication, business logic, and server configuration. Database management involves designing, creating, and managing databases to store and retrieve data. Server-side logic involves writing server-side code that handles requests from the frontend, processes data, and sends appropriate responses back. API development includes creating and maintaining application programming interfaces for the frontend to interact with backend services. Authentication involves implementing user authentication to ensure secure access to applications. Performance optimization ensures that backend services run efficiently and can handle high traffic loads. Integration with third-party services involves connecting the application with external services, such as payment gateways and third-party APIs.

2. Imagine you‚Äôre working as a full-stack developer in the near future. Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice. How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team? Drawing from what you learned in this exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option? *(Hint: refer to the exercise section ‚ÄúThe Benefits of Developing with Python‚Äù)*

Answer: -  Let's use Python for our project. Although JavaScript is capable of achieving the same functionalities we need, Python's syntax is much easier to write and read, which will be beneficial for our team. For example, to perform a simple calculation like 
ùëé
+
ùëè
a+b, in JavaScript, we might need to create a function and handle additional complexities. In Python, we can simply write c = a + b on a single line. This simplicity not only speeds up our development process but also reduces the likelihood of errors, making our codebase easier to maintain and extend. Moreover, Python has extensive libraries and frameworks that can help us handle various tasks more efficiently, from data analysis to machine learning, providing us with more flexibility and power for future project needs.

3. Now that you‚Äôve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you. What do you want to learn about Python? What do you want to get out of this Achievement? Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?

Answer: - 

Learn Python for Web Development

I want to learn how to use Python to create web applications. My specific goal is to build a mortgage calculator. To achieve this, I need to understand Python's basics like variables, data types, loops, conditionals, functions, and object-oriented programming. This will give me a solid foundation for more advanced Python tasks.

Complete Practical Projects Using Python

I aim to complete several hands-on projects using Python. These projects could include things like simple websites, data analysis tools, or automation scripts. Working on real projects will help me understand how to apply what I‚Äôve learned and gain practical experience.

Prepare for a Job in Software Development

My ultimate goal is to be ready for a job in software development where I can use Python. I want to be good enough at Python to confidently apply for jobs that need Python skills. I also plan to create a portfolio of Python projects to show potential employers what I can do.
These goals will help me stay focused and motivated. After completing this course, I see myself working in a job where I can create useful software solutions, possibly in web development or data analysis, using Python.
